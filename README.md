## Overview

### The challenge

The application will allow a user to interact with the records stored in the database to view existing records, add new items, and backup/export the existing state of the database into a CSV file.

Need to add a screenshot, or find out how to add a quick gif clip of the app running

## My process

### Built with

- SQLAlchemy 2.0.34
- Python 12.5

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to clean data effectively before setting up the database using SQLAlchemy and Python. Although I am new to both Python and SQL, my ability to think logically and create pseudocode helped me overcome challenges throughout the process.

### Continued development

While this is a basic CLI application, I do think this would be a _GREAT_ start to a backend for a Full Stack application for a portfolio project.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to give some credit to those within the Team Treehouse slack/discord channel. There is a major bonus to learning, when you can learn from peers who are also learning the same material as you. 

Also, I'd like to give a major shoutout to [Keraion](https://www.twitch.tv/keraion) on Twitch for assisting with breaking down different ways to filter results, clean data and just open my eyes to some additional resources to learn from! Thank you üôè
